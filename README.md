# WeatherApp

## Description 

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use localStorage to store any persistent data.

## User Story 

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Credits 

I worked with my tutor to create this application.
